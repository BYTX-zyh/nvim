# About
My personal nvim configuration written in lua  with lots of person hack.

For some new vimer, I recommend use my another configuration
[ThinkVim](https://github.com/hardcoreplayers/ThinkVim) or use my cli tool
[Jarvim](https://github.com/glepnir/jarvim) to generate a module vim
configuration.
